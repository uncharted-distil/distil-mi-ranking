# distil-mi-ranking

**Deprecated.  Moved into `distil-primitives.`**

Feature ranking based on a mutual information between features and a selected target.  Will rank any feature column with a semantic type of `Float`, `Boolean`, `Integer` or `Categorical`, and a corresponding structural type of `int` or `float`. A DataFrame containing `(col_idx, col_name, score)` tuples for each ranked feature will be returned to the caller.  Features that could not be ranked are excluded from the returned set.
